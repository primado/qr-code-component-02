## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Library


### What I learned

I knew Tailwind CSS is very cool but in my first try I didn't understand, which was months ago. So after I got a grip of CSS and HTML, I tried again and it was very easy to use. I'm very happy with the result.

```html
<div class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center h-screen">
    <div class="w-80 h-80">
        <div class="bg-black w-full h-full rounded-md"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="w-80 h-80">
        <div class="bg-white w-full h-full rounded-md"></div>
    </div>
</div>
```

```css
.bg-black {
    @apply bg-black;
}

.bg-white {
    @apply bg-white;
}
```

#### Continued development

I'm thinking about using Tailwind CSS in my next projects, because it's very easy to use and I like the result.

#### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me for the CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
